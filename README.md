# SCP-SL-Tutorial-Hints
I have put together two zip files one of which includes new music for you to enjoy as well as a hint system replacing most of C.A.S.S.I.E.'s subtitles.

To add them to your SCP:SL, Open Steam and right click `SCP: Secret Laboratory` in your library, click `Manage` and click `Browse Local Files`
Download and extract both .zip files.
For `music` drag and drop the whole file into your SL folder.
For the `Tutorial` folder, double left click `Translations` in the SCP:SL folder
And drag and drop the whole `Tutorial` folder into the `Translations` folder.
Restart SCP:SL if it's already open and go to `Settings`
Then open `Interface`
And in the `Interface Language` option left click the drop down menu and scroll until you see `English (Tutorial)` and select it.
Now it's recommended that you restart SCP:SL again to ensure all the changes were made.
Now hop on in-game and learn the fun that is SCP: Secret Laboratory!

Please keep in mind this only an early version of this and not everything is finished and described properly. If you speak a different language then sadly there's not much I can do about it as I don't know any other languages besides English. As for music, it includes all of SCP - Containment Breach's soundtrack as well as few of SCP: Secret Laboratories unused/removed/trailer music.

Regardless please enjoy this as I worked hard on it. More will come soon!

See ya lads!
